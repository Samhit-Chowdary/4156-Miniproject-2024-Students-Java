Bugs Found:

I fixed all the test cases when writing the unit test cases. didnt find any new ones with pmd check.

File 1) Course.java

1) enrolledStudentCount was initialised to 500 but it should be initialised to 0.
2) enrollStudent method is missing the check for filled course. added the check and returned true only if enrollStudent is successful.
3) dropStudent method is missing the check for empty class. added the check and returned true only if drop student is successful.
4) getCourseLocation method is returning instructor name. returned proper course location
5) getInstructorName method is returning course location. returned proper course instructor name
6) isCourseFull method logic is wrong. it should return true if and only if course capacity is equal to the no of students enrolled.

File 2) Department.java

1) getNumberOfMajors method is returning negative of the number of majors. returned the proper value.
2) getDepartmentChair method is returning "this.departmentChair"(String). removed the double quotes.
3) dropPersonFromMajor method is missing the check for zero majors. Only dropping the person if there is any.
4) toString method is returning "result.toString()"(String). removed the double quotes.

File 3) RouteController.java

1) retrieveDepartment method is returning status: ok when department is not found. fixed it to status: not found.
2) retrieveDepartment method is returning status: not found when the department is found. fixed it to status: ok.
3) retrieveCourse method is returning status: forbidden when the request successful. fixed it to status: ok.
4) getMajorCtFromDept method is renamed to getMajorCountFromDept method.
5) getMajorCountFromDept method is doing negation of the no. of majors returned. fixed it to a proper value.
6) getMajorCountFromDept method is returning status: forbidden when department is not found. fixed it to status: not found.
7) findCourseTime method is returning hardcoded "some time" string in the response. fixed it to proper course time slot.
8) dropStudent method is returning status: bad request when student is not dropped. fixed it to status: not found (because student is a resource is not found).
9) handleException method is returning status: ok when handling exception. fixed it to status: internal server error.
